Throughout the various rebuilds of my site; I've often included updated visuals along with new libraries. This time around, I focused the UI-building tool; swapping out TailwindCSS for [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com).

  This doesn't mean I'm moving on from TailwindCSS - quite the contrary.
  Previously in my career, I would let the tooling dictate the project. I've
  since learned that the project should dictate the tooling. With that in mind,
  a minimalist portfolio site was the perfect opportunity to try out Panda CSS.
