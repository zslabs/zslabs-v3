When plotting data on the web, there's lots to consider for a consistent experience:

- What type of graph is appropriate to differentiate the data?
- Will my axis labels scale down on smaller screens?
- Is the graphing library configurable enough to support customizations; while not introducing a technical-layer that is hard to scale in the future?

For a recent project; I was tasked with replicating large sets of data, amongst numerous types of graphs - that needed to check-off each of the boxes above.

### Choosing a graph library

The open-source community never seizes to amaze me. Spurring from a suggestion by [@kyehohenberger](https://twitter.com/kyehohenberger), [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) came away as the perfect-pairing to meet both the design and technical needs of the project.

Built on-top of [D3](https://d3js.org/), Nivo provides a wealth of pre-configured graph-types - with a highly extensible API-layer that allowed me to move fast and make changes along the way.

### Placing axis labels

With libraries like [@visx/text](https://airbnb.io/visx/text) alongside Nivo's `labels` property, we're able to fit SVG `<text />` elements into tight-spots; with auto-wrapping.

Where this method starts to falls-apart, is when we view large sets of data along an axis on small screens. We're faced with two ill-fated scenarios - text which is too small to read OR text that overlaps each other.

For this project; I decided to create a custom legend outside of the graph; which I could control with normal HTML/CSS for a more dependable experience on all screen-sizes. Because I defined a dedicated pallette via Nivo's `colors` property, I passed-through my dataset and looped over it; matching to each color instance perfectly.

### Updating graph properties based on screen size

While Nivo provides scalable variants for many of their graphs; such as `<ResponsivePie />` and `<ResponsiveBar />`, altering their configuration based on screen-size is not something that is available out-of-the-box.

Luckily, we can use a `matchMedia` hook to re-render the graph with updated properties whenever we'd like:

```js filename=useMatchMedia.js
import * as React from 'react'

// @SOURCE https://gist.github.com/donaldpipowitch/b454bbfbc3c81a6708a915086cc0de31

// Pass a query like `(min-width: 768px)`
export function useMatchMedia(query) {
  // SSR check
  const [matches, setMatches] = React.useState(() =>
    typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.matchMedia(query).matches : null
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia(query)
    const onChange = (event) => setMatches(event.matches)

    mediaQueryList.addListener(onChange)

    return () => mediaQueryList.removeListener(onChange)
  }, [query])

  return matches
}
```

By using `matchMedia` instead of a generic `resize` listener; we can update our view based on a singular, performant event.

```js filename=MyGraph.js
import { ResponsiveBar } from '@nivo/bar'

import useMatchMedia from '~hooks/useMatchMedia'

export default function MyGraph() {
  const isLargeScreen = useMatchMedia('(min-width: 768px)')

  const graphProps = {
    groupMode: 'grouped',
    layout: 'horizontal',
    enableGridX: true,
    enableGridY: false,
    innerPadding: 2,
    margin: isLargeScreen
      ? { left: 160, bottom: 25, right: 10 }
      : { left: 5, bottom: 25, right: 10 },
    ...(!isLargeScreen && { axisLeft: null }),
  }

  return <ResponsiveBar {...graphProps} />
}
```

Nivo has quickly become my go-to for data visualization and am looking forward to using it on my next project.
