title: Consolidating Netlify CMS

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is a powerful, pluggable content management system for static site generators that removes the need for building your own backend. My favorite way to utilize it is combined with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/); that both provide even easier ways to get up and running.

With the power of a centralized `config.yml` file, you are able to pass through information to the CMS that prescribe repo integration, permission settings, collections, fields, and more.

```yaml filename=config.yml
# Connect to your datastore
backend:
  name: github
  repo: username/repo
  branch: master
# Permissions for "how" content is pushed to your repo
publish_mode: editorial_workflow
# Configure media upload destinations
media_folder: /static/uploads
public_folder: /uploads
# Content
collections:
  - label: 'Posts'
    name: 'posts'
    folder: 'src/posts'
    create: true
    fields:
      - { label: 'SEO Title', name: 'seoTitle', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Meta Description', name: 'description', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Title', name: 'title', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Date', name: 'date', widget: 'date', format: 'YYYY-MM-DD' }
      - { label: 'Body', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' }
```

With the config above, we're able to populate the Netlify CMS with a CRUD interface for creating blog posts that can talk to our GitHub repo.

Unfortunately, this all starts crumbling alongside complex projects with a myriad of collection and fields. A recent project had reached almost 1,500 lines of config; which presented a few issues:

1. Was incredibly hard to visually grep.
1. Since YAML is indention-dependent, complex collections were fragile to modify and add fields.
1. Extending from or creating reusable partials is not an option.
1. Extending the Netlify CMS with additional plugins/custom widgets is unclear and/or impossible.

When it was time to add yet another collection-type, I decided to take a step back and look into alternative options. Enter [Manual Initialization](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#manual-initialization). This allows us to write our CMS init with standard JS that gives us more flexibility on "how" we write our configuration. Let's take a look at how we might accomplish the same thing using manual initialization.

```js filename=cms.js
// This global flag enables manual initialization.
window.CMS_MANUAL_INIT = true

import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'

import { posts } from './collections/posts'

CMS.init({
  config: {
    load_config_file: false,
    backend: {
      name: 'github',
      repo: 'username/repo',
      branch: 'master',
    },
    publish_mode: 'editorial_workflow',
    media_folder: '/static/uploads',
    public_folder: '/uploads',
    collections: [posts],
  },
})
```

```js filename=posts.js
import { seo } from '../partials/seo'

export const posts = {
  label: 'Posts',
  name: 'posts',
  folder: 'src/posts',
  create: true,
  fields: [
    ...seo,
    {
      label: 'Title',
      name: 'title',
      widget: 'string',
    },
    {
      label: 'Date',
      name: 'date',
      widget: 'date',
      format: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
    },
    {
      label: 'Body',
      name: 'body',
      widget: 'markdown',
    },
  ],
}
```

```js filename=seo.js
export const seo = [
  {
    label: 'SEO Title',
    name: 'title',
    widget: 'string',
  },
  {
    label: 'Meta Description',
    name: 'description',
    widget: 'string',
  },
]
```

What are we able to solve with the above?

1. Consolidated init file that can continue to grow as project complexity does.
2. Utilize packages like [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain code-quality.
3. Create reusable partials by using native JS object functionality.
4. Open platform to modify core behavior and add in custom widgets/plugins.

Why would Netlify CMS have `config.yml` then if manual initialization gives us so much power? Because not all projects will be complex. Not all projects will have needs that extend from what a single-file config can provide. The single-file config also removes a barrier to entry for users that may not want to add this complexity to their project. What it means for me, is having a platform that provides me with either option.
