title: MDX previews in Netlify CMS

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an incredible toolkit that allows you to write [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) in your Markdown files; creating opportunities for more dynamic and interactive experiences in your content.

What's even better than the technology itself, is the ability it provides content-contributors to work alongside these advanced components within the articles they're crafting. When coupled with GUI interfaces like [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), we're able to provide an abstraction-layer for whatever technology we're using.

> Technology is only as good as the simplicity it introduces.

### The problem

While Netlify CMS provides a wealth of features upfront that makes setup and creating collection-types easy, an assumption it doesn't make is within its preview-panel.

This normally wouldn't be a huge deal. We're able to see the fields and parsed Markdown - albeit rough. But, as we look closer at the article, we can see some MDX components that either don't show anything at all or present a vastly different experience than what would be expected within the preview panel.

### The solution

Luckily, Netlify CMS is [pluggable](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/customization/), and allows us to hook into and generate our own previews per collection-type:

```js filename=cms.js
import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'

... // CMS.init() functionality

CMS.registerPreviewTemplate('posts', withEmotion(ArticlePreview))
```

In my case, I also wanted to wrap the iFrame that powers the preview and utilize [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), so a [HOC](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) was created to target and provide that scope:

```js filename=withEmotion.js
import { CacheProvider, Global } from '@emotion/core'
import createCache from '@emotion/cache'
import weakMemoize from '@emotion/weak-memoize'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'
import { theme } from 'chaoskit/src/assets/styles/theme'
import { globalStyles } from 'chaoskit/src/assets/styles/global'
import { Container } from 'chaoskit/src/components'

const memoizedCreateCacheWithContainer = weakMemoize((container) => {
  const newCache = createCache({ container })

  return newCache
})

export default (Component) => (props) => {
  const iframe = document.querySelector('#nc-root iframe')
  const iframeHeadElem = iframe && iframe.contentDocument.head

  if (!iframeHeadElem) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <CacheProvider value={memoizedCreateCacheWithContainer(iframeHeadElem)}>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <Global styles={[globalStyles(theme)]} />
        <Container
          css={{
            paddingTop: theme.space.base,
            paddingBottom: theme.space.base,
          }}
        >
          <Component {...props} />
        </Container>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </CacheProvider>
  )
}
```

Finally, we are ready to tackle the preview render:

```js filename=MDXPreview.js
import MDX from 'mdx-scoped-runtime'

const MDXPreview = ({ entry }) => {
  const theme = useTheme()

  return (
    <MDX
      components={
        {
          // DOM element + React component overrides
        }
      }
    >
      {entry.getIn(['data', 'body'])}
    </MDX>
  )
}

MDXPreview.propTypes = {
  entry: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}

export default MDXPreview
```

[mdx-scoped-runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-scoped-runtime) comes to the rescue with the ability to parse MDX on-the-fly. We can then use this component alongside any other fields we want to display within our preview.

```js filename=ArticlePreview.js
import MDXPreview from './MDXPreview'

const ArticlePreview = ({ entry }) => <MDXPreview entry={entry} />

ArticlePreview.propTypes = {
  entry: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}

export default ArticlePreview
```

/>

### Gatsby tip

For scenarios where you may have components that use a bit more [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) magic than what `mdx-scoped-runtime` can provide; like [graphql](https://graphql.org/), you can override the default behavior to provide a fallback component as needed to avoid compilation errors:

```js filename=MDXPreview.js
import MDX from 'mdx-scoped-runtime'

const UnsupportedComponent = ({ label, ...rest }) => (
  <div {...rest}>
    <code>{label}</code> requires a bit more magic than we are able to display
    in the CMS.
  </div>
)

UnsupportedComponent.propTypes = {
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}

const MDXPreview = ({ entry }) => {
  const theme = useTheme()

  return (
    <MDX
      components={{
        SuperSpecialGatsbyComponent: () => (
          <UnsupportedComponent label="SuperSpecialGatsbyComponent" />
        ),
      }}
    >
      {entry.getIn(['data', 'body'])}
    </MDX>
  )
}

MDXPreview.propTypes = {
  entry: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
}

export default MDXPreview
```
